# Octopus Brains Sync
Octopus Brains Sync is an idea about creating synchronized tools that are brain extension of yourself.


It is 2 AM.
After watching a documentary on Ant and Octopus, a coin fall and a brick of logic was added to my project Open Macro Input.

I have been thinking since weeks about making synchronised boolean tables between the application to have a better discussion from devices to devices.
Allowing them to activate actions in my games. 

I was sepctical on the time of investement versus future result.

But after watching those documentary, I understood one thing. 
As the phone is an exception of yourself, my software OMI will be too.
Meaning that it need to think by himseft to be efficient.

But my sub software are like the skin and arm of the octopus.
They must think and react by them-self but be party synchronised/control by the brain of the "leg"
And the main body of the Octopus must think and adapte those to live.


So if I want to my software to be more "useful", I need to think of them like a body part of myself the is autonomious but synnchronised with my artificial brain.
And my artificial brain need to be syncrhonised with my body that is syncrhronised with myself...


That a 2AM thinking.  
So it is dumb.

But like a "old" saying said:
