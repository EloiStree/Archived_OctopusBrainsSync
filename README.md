# Octopus Brains Sync
Octopus Brains Sync is an idea about creating synchronized tools that are brain extension of yourself.


It is 2 AM.
After watching a documentary on Ant and Octopus, a coin fall and a brick of logic was added to my project Open Macro Input.

I have been thinking since weeks about making synchronised boolean tables between the application to have a better discussion from devices to devices.
Allowing them to activate actions in my games. 

I was septical on the time to invest versus the future result.

But after watching those documentary, I understood one thing. 
As the phone is an exception of yourself, my software OMI will be too.
Meaning that it need to think by himseft to be efficient.

My sub software should be like the skin and arms of the octopus.
They must think and react by them-self at hight speed but be partialy synchronised/control by the brain of the "leg"
And the main body of the Octopus must think and adapte those leg to live.

But as the brain throughs are not good at thinking in muscules reactions it must delegate that to some part of the brain that are independant of the thinking.
So maybe I should have a phone (or else) that is dedicated to that action. 24H/24 7J/7 be the artificial brains synch communicator to those multipiples other brains.


So if I want to my software to be more "useful", I need to think of them like a body part of myself that are autonomious but synnchronised with my artificial brain.
And my artificial brain need to be syncrhonised with my body that is syncrhronised with myself...


```
PS: An other thinking based on Ant that was in the process. Ants are the brain extension of a group representing the queen. In some ants colonize when the queen die the ants let's themself die. The extension of the Octopus project could be to have software that are incomplete without the rest of them.

To give a exemple: In video game, we have the game and we have the input in the game. Meaning that every game developer and application creator have to re-design the input game configuration. When it would be so much better if like for my Open Macro Input, the game creator create some public function to be called and the user with it software control those function to play with the software he want.

So the idea here is to create atomique software that do small task with good coding in it. But required the sync brain information to apply them.

It make the sync artificial brain less big and less complexe and the small action softare less big and more dispensable.

An other piece of the puzzle.   
I keep asking myself:
"how could we create intelligent software if we consider it to be able to turn it on and off when we want."
If it is that inteligent that mean that it should be useful to you.

And the definition of something useful is that once you use it you can't do without it.

So for me the only way I see the future of my project Open Macro Input is to become Octopus.
An extension of your intents to live with machines as "one" but you.


Don't expect it tomorrow. That a life time project idea.
It is frightening, but as it is for life and kids. 


That a 2AM thinking.  
So it is dumb.

But like a "old" saying said:
